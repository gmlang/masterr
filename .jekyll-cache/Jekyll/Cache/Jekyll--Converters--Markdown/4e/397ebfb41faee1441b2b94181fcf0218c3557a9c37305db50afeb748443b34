I"è<p>When analyzing stock returns, we like to know if the average returns or volatilities are constant over time, or if the correlations between any two assets in our portfolio stay constant over time. Therefore, we need to pick a time windows and calculate the rolling means, volatilities or correlations. A common choice for a time window is 2 years. However, in practice, I often pick several time windows of different length (like 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years) and compare the results obtained under each time window. The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rollapply()</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zoo</code> library allows us to calculate the rolling statistics easily.</p>
