I"Ú<p>I didnâ€™t pay much attention to code style until recently when I had to collaborate with a couple of guys on a project. That experience taught me having a consistent style across all team members can greatly reduce communication time and help people understand each otherâ€™s code. If youâ€™re not already using a style, you should decide on a style today. Even if you program solo, you will also benefit from sticking to a style. It will allow you to write code faster, for example, once you choose a style, you donâ€™t have to spend time deciding whether you should use all lowercase letters chained by dots or undersores or use camelCase everytime you write a variable name. It will also make your code easier to read.</p>
