I"Ù<p>When constructing a portfolio, itâ€™s important to pick un-correlated assets. This is just a corollary of the â€œdonâ€™t put all your eggs in one basketâ€ principle. If asset B goes up (or down) when asset A goes up (or down) and vice versa, thereâ€™s really no reason to own both assets. By and large, assets of different classes are weakly correlated, for example, stocks and bonds, stocks and gold, and etc. In <a href="https://masterr.org/r/analyze-stock-price-data-using-r-part1/">part1</a>, I said Iâ€™m interested in a vanguard energy fund (VGENX) because oil price has been hammered. However, because I already own the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX), I want to find out how correlated VGENX is with VTSMX.</p>
