I"~<p>When doing data cleaning, we often have to clean up strings of text. Doing this in R used to be a pain until the birth of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html">stringr</a> package. For example, it contains a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str_trim()</code> that allows you to easily remove any leading and trailing whitespace of a string. It also contains a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str_sub()</code> that allows you to easily extract substrings from any string. Run the following code to see these two functions work.</p>
