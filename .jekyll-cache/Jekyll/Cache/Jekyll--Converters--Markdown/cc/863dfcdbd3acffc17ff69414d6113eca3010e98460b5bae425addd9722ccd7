I" <p>This is the first article of a series on how environments work in R. If this
sounds foreign to you, youâ€™re probably wondering, â€œwhat is a R environment?â€ 
Donâ€™t. Instead, ask â€œwhat does a R environment do?â€ This is because 99% of the 
utility lies in understanding how it behaves. And yes, you can understand how it 
behaves without knowing what it is, which is confusing given that different 
things are carelessly named the same in the official R manual. For now, just
think of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environment</code> as a container. Or if you want, you can even take its 
english meaning (after all, programmers try to name things vividly). Every time
you open Rstudio, youâ€™re inside an environment called the global environment.
How do I know that? You can check it yourself by running the following command
inside Rstudio. It tells you the current envionment youâ€™re in.</p>
