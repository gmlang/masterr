I"Ô<p>Previously, we discussed two data structures in R: <a href="https://masterr.org/r/RFP-part1-vectors/">vectors</a> and <a href="https://masterr.org/r/RFP-part2-lists/">lists</a>. If you programmed in another language before, you probably already got a sense that R vectors and lists are a tiny bit different than what youâ€™re used to. This is to be expected. In general, there is a nuanced difference between R data structures and that of many other languages.</p>
