I"<p>How do you sort a data frame by one or more of its variables? This is one of the activities I do a lot when analyzing a dataset, so I wrote a function to take care of the details. It uses two other functions, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do.call()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order()</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do.call()</code> takes in two arguments: a function and a list of arguments that can be passed to it. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">order()</code> does the sorting, and you can look up how it works by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?order</code>. Hereâ€™s the function I wrote that can make sorting data frames much easier.</p>
