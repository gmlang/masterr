I"œ<p><a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">XGBoost</a> is probably the most cutting-edge and optimized implementation of the gradient boosting algorithms. If youâ€™re a R user, you probably used GBM in the past. XGBoost is generally over 10 times faster than GBM. Unfortunately, its official installation document for R users on a Mac OS isnâ€™t clear. In this post, Iâ€™m going to walk you through how to install the multi-thread version of the XGBoost R package on a Mac OS X El Capitan. You want the multi-thread version because you want to have the option of using more than 1 core of your machine simultaneously to run the algorithms in parallel.</p>
