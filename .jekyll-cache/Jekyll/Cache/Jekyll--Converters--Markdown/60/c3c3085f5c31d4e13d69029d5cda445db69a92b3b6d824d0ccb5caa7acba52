I"-<p>Before you can do any analysis, you need to first read in the data. One thing that’s not so nice about R is that it loads the entire dataset into RAM. As a result, if the dataset is bigger than your RAM, R will run out of memory before it can read in the data. So it’s a good habit to check the size of the data first. Sometimes this is simply a matter of looking it up. Other times, you’ll know the number of rows and columns in the dataset, and you can calculate a lower bound for its size by assuming the data are all numeric. Here’s how.</p>
