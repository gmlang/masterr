I"<p>Dealing with date variables is usually tedious. When reading in a text data file into R, R will not automatically convert the date values into dates, rather, it will treat them as strings (make sure you specify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code> in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read.table()</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read.csv()</code> function. Otherwise, R will read in them as factors, which you don’t want). Sometimes, the date values are of the format “yyyymmdd”, like “20051023”, and R will treat them as numbers. It’s your job to convert these strings or numbers to dates. I’ve written a function that allows you to do that easily.</p>
