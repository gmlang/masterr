I"æ<p>Have you written functions in R before? If you have, I want you to go back to one of the functions you wrote and take a look at its input and output. Does it take in a piece of data and return another piece of data, be it a number, string, vector, data frame, matrix, or list? Now, if all or most of your functions are like that, youâ€™re missing out on the true power of functions. Do you know that you can write functions to return a function instead of a data structure? (<a href="https://masterr.org/r/functions-that-return-functions/">part1</a>, <a href="https://masterr.org/r/functions-that-return-functions-part-2/">part2</a>) Do you also know that you can write functions to return a list of functions instead of one function?</p>
