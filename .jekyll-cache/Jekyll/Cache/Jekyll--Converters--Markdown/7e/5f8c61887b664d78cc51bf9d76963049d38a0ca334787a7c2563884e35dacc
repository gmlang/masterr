I"Æ<p>The relationship between the number of rows (n) and the number of columns (p) is important for choosing which predictive modeling techniques to use when providing predictive analytics solutions. If n &lt; p, thereâ€™s always a risk that a relevant predictor found in the training data set will not be reproducible. In addition, some predictive modeling techniques such as multiple linear regression (and multivariate regression analysis for more than one outcome variables) or linear discriminant analysis cannot be directly used when n &lt; p. Yet, some models such as regression tree, classification tree, random forest and the k nearest neighbors algorithm (KNNs) can be used directly when n &lt; p.</p>
