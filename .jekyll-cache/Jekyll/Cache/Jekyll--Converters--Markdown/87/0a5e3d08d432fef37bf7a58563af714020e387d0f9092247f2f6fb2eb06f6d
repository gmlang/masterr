I"²<p>In a <a href="https://masterr.org/r/calculate-global-minimum-variance-portfolio-using-r/">previous post</a>, I showed how to calculate the global minimum variance portfolio using R and vanguard funds in my retirement account. It had an average  annual return of 5.2% and volatility of 3.3% in the past 10 years. Because Iâ€™m holding those funds for a long term, at least 30 years. I donâ€™t really mind a bigger volatility now. Instead, I really want a bigger return, say 10%. So Iâ€™ll set my target return as 10%, and find a portfolio that can achieve it. The resulting portfolio is called mean-variance efficient because it has the smallest volatility for the 10% target return.</p>
