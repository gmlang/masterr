I"F<p>In a <a href="https://masterr.org/r/calculate-efficient-portfolios-using-r/">previous post</a>, I showed how to calculate the efficient portfolio given a target return using R and vanguard funds in my retirement account. All assets I used previously are risky assets. However, we can also hold risk free assets in our portfolio, for example, 1 year <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield">t-bills</a>. After having included risk free assets, we can define something called the Sharpe Slope as the difference between our portfolio return and the risk free rate divided by the volatility of our portfolio. The bigger the Sharpe Slope the better. So our objective is to find the portfolio with the biggest Sharpe Slope, and this is called tangency portfolio.</p>
