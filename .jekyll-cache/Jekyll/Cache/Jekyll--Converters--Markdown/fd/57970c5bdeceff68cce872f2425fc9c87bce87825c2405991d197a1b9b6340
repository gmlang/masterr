I"Ã<p>When we use the word <em>correlation</em> in conversations, we usually mean â€œrelationship.â€ For example, when we say â€œsales of ice cream are correlated with the weather,â€ we mean â€œice cream sales and the weather are related, and we tend to sell more ice creams in the summer than winter.â€ However, when used in data analysis, the word <em>correlation</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is a mathematical construct, and therefore, has a precise meaning, namely, it measures the â€œlinear relationshipâ€ between two continuous variables. We need to remember this distinction so that we can understand and interpret it correctly. For example, zero correlation in the context of data analysis doesnâ€™t mean thereâ€™s no relationship. It simply means thereâ€™s no linear relationship, and itâ€™s perfectly possible that thereâ€™s a strong non-linear relationship. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#mediaviewer/File:Correlation_examples2.svg">This wikipedia plot</a> summarizes a list of possible relationships when the correlation is zero.</p>

<p>Another thing to remember is that correlation is sensitive to outliers. As we can see from the following plots, one outlier decreases the correlation from 0.95 to 0.79. In situations like this, we need to examine the outliers and decide if they can be removed. If we cannot make that decisions, we need to carry out a sensitivity analysis, i.e., run the same analysis on the data with and without the outliers and compare the results.</p>
