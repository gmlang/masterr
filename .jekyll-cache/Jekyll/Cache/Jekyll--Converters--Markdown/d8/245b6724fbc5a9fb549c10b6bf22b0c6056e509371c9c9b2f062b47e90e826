I"Û<p>Exponential smoothing is a simple method to forecast the future given the present and the past. You can use it to forecast sales, revenues, production levels, marketing expenses, the weather, stock prices, and many other things that happend over time. Itâ€™s crude so sometimes it doesnâ€™t work well. But sometimes it does work fine, and you can often use it as a data processing tool to smooth out timeseries data before using them to build more complicated models.</p>
