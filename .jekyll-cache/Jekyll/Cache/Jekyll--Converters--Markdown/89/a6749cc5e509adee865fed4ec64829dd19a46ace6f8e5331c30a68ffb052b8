I"G<p>Hey, welcome. I’m Guangming Lang, the owner of MasterR.org, and if you ever asked yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I want to learn R, and where do I start?”</li>
  <li>“How can I become better at R?”</li>
  <li>“How can I become really awesome in R?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Or if you’ve ever just needed to quickly find the right R function to do your task at hand…</p>

<p>…You’re in the RIGHT place!</p>

<h1 id="heres-how-master-r-helps-you-become-great-at-r">Here’s How Master R Helps You Become Great at R</h1>
<p>As the chief economist at Google Hal Varian said, “the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians.” As Forbes’ one of the world’s 7 most powerful data scientists DJ Patil said, “data scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century.” I’m here to teach you the most powerful tool statisticians or data scientists use in their everyday work.</p>

<p>Here’s the deal:</p>

<p><strong>I believe statisticians and data scientists who want to win in today’s competitive job market MUST also become master R programmers.</strong></p>

<p>Now, there’re tons of R learning materials out there. In fact, too many to tell which ones are excellent and which ones are bad, which ones are useful and which ones are useless. How can you find the time to sort all these out and learn by yourself while catching a deadline… while taking 5 classes… while working a full-time job…</p>

<p>Instead of digging through hundreds of books, thousands of stack overflow QAs, tens of thousands of google searches, and wasting time on dry materials or materials that talk about the less often used R features…</p>

<p>…subscribe to MasterR.org (it’s free), and you’ll get the most effective R training materials and best tips from me, Guangming Lang.</p>

<p>And the best part? I’ll cut through the fluff, showing you exactly what’s going on step by step, and giving you exectly the R code data scientists write to solve practical real world problems.</p>

<p>All because I have a knack for explaining how things work in R intuitively, and for writing INSANELY PRACTICAL RE-USEABLE R functions and packages that you can start benefiting from TODAY.</p>

<h1 id="introducing-masterrorg-the-blog-and-the-videos">Introducing MasterR.org (The Blog and The Videos)</h1>
