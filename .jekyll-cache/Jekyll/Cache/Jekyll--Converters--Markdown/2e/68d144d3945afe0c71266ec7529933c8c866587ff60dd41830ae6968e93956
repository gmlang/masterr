I"!<p>Do not confuse variable reassignment (or rebinding) with mutation. Reassignment in R changes the binding. (See the <a href="https://masterr.org/r/RFP-part4-shadowing/">second diagram</a> for an example.) Mutation changes the referenced object itself. R supports limited mutation by default and base R objects are mostly immutable. As a result, R code often behaves like what we’d expect it to behave mathematically. This allows the programmer to focus on the mathematical or statistical problem at hand without being distracted by the “computer side of things.” Indeed, if you’re trained as a mathematician or statistician without any programming experience, you’ll find it’s easier to write R code than most typical programming languages like Python, Ruby, Java, C++, or Rust etc.</p>
