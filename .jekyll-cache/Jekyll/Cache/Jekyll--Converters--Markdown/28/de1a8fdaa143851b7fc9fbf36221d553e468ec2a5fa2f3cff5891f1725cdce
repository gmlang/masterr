I"À<p>R is my favorite tool for data analysis except when it comes to dealing with large datasets. If the data file is larger than the size of your RAM, R will fail at reading it in. So when you have a large dataset, you should first check if you have enough memory. I showed <a href="https://masterr.org/r/how-to-handle-large-datasets-in-r-part-1/">a method of doing that</a> when all you know is the number of rows and columns in the data file.</p>
