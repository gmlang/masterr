I"î<p>Machine Learning or Statistical Learning methods fall into a spectrum according to their flexibility. At the left end of the spectrum, for example, when dealing with a regression problem where the response variable is quantitative, you have lasso and linear regression, which are very restrictive and hence inflexible since they impose a linear structure onto what the true model looks like. Moving to the right, you have splines models which allow non-linearity, and hence are more flexible. Similarly, when facing a classification problem where the response variable is qualitative, you can use \(k\)-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, where a bigger \(k\) corresponds to a less flexible model. When \(k=1\), the model is the most flexible.</p>
