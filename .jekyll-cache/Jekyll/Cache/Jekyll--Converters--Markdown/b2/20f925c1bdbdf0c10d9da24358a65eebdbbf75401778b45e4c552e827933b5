I"¬<p>A lot of my clients think more data lead to more accurate models, but this may not be true. Hereâ€™s why.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Noise in the predictors or the response are also likely to increase as more data are collected, and hence reduce any positive impact of the large sample on model quality.</li>
  <li>The law of diminishing returns. Beyond a certain point, more of the same data from the same population wonâ€™t improve models by much.</li>
  <li>More data lead to more computational burden and cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of collecting more data, itâ€™s often better to collect different data. In other words, increase P (number of predictors) instead of N (sample size).</p>
