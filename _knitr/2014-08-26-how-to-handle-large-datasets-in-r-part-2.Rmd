R is my favorite tool for data analysis except when it comes to dealing with large datasets. If the data file is larger than the size of your RAM, R will fail at reading it in. So when you have a large dataset, you should first check if you have enough memory. I showed [a method of doing that](http://gmlang.com/r/how-to-handle-large-datasets-in-r-part-1/) when all you know is the number of rows and columns in the data file. 

Let's say you find out the data file is too large for R to handle, what would you do? You can take a random sample from the data file, read and analyze the sample using R. The following `readbig()` function does that. It reads the input data file in chunks, takes a sample of user specified size, and returns the read-in data as a data frame.

```{r}
readbig = function (file, samplesz, chunksz, sep=',', header=TRUE, nrec=0, ...) {
        ## this function reads in a random sample of a big input data file
        
        ## @file: input file path
        ## @samplesz: sample size
        ## @chunksz: size of chunks to read in at each iteration
        ## @header: logical value indicating if the input file has a header
        ## @nrec: number of rows in input file. If @nrec is <= 0, this function
        ##        will use operating system command to find out its value.
        ##        Default value is 0. 
        
        # a pretty efficient way to find the number of lines in file
        # comment out the following appropriate codeblocks (line16-28) 
        # depending on your operating system.
        
#         # Windows: 
#         # shell('type "comma.txt" | find /c ","', intern=TRUE)
#         if(nrec <= 0) 
#                 nrec = as.numeric(
#                         shell( paste0('type ',file,' | find /c ','"',sep,'"'), 
#                                intern=TRUE ) )
        
        # Mac or Linux:
        # system('cat comma.txt | wc -l', intern=TRUE)
        if(nrec <= 0) 
                nrec = as.numeric(
                        system( paste0('cat ',file,' | wc -l'), 
                                intern=TRUE ) )
        
        # create a file connection
        f = file(file, 'r')
        on.exit(close(f))
        
        # take a sample (of size samplesz) of the row indices and sort them
        use = sort(sample(1:nrec, samplesz))
        
        # read the 1st line
        line1 = readLines(f,1) 
        
        # calculate the number of cols of the file
        line1 = unlist(strsplit(line1,sep)[[1]])
        k = length(line1)
        
        # re-position the file to its origin
        seek(f,0) 
        
        # make a zero-matrix with samplesz rows and k cols
        result = data.frame(matrix(NA, samplesz, k))
        
        # initialize some values
        read = 0
        got = 1
        left = nrec
        skip_row = 0
        
        # skip the header if there's one
        if (header) {
                left = nrec - 1 
                skip_row = 1
                names(result) = line1
        }
        
        while(left > 0){
                # read the next chunk (each chuck has size chunksz) from f
                now = read.table(f, nrows=chunksz, skip=skip_row, sep=sep, ...) 
                
                # don't skip the 1st row when reading in the 2nd, 3rd, ... block
                skip_row = 0   
                begin = read + 1
                end = read + chunksz
                
                # extract row indices in both the chunk and the sample 
                want = (begin:end)[begin:end %in% use] - read 
                
                # get sampled data
                if (length(want) > 0) {
                        nowdat = now[want,]
                        newgot = got + length(want) - 1
                        result[got:newgot,] = nowdat
                        got = newgot + 1
                }
                read = read + chunksz
                left = left - chunksz
        }
        
        return(result)
