Previously, I showed [how to make ordered bar charts using ggplot2](https://masterr.org/r/how-to-work-with-factors-in-r/). Sometimes, you want to create multiple facets and put on each facet an ordered bar chart. Here's how you can do that using ggplot2.
```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
suppressMessages({library(ggplot2)})

# make fake data
df = data.frame(val = rnorm(10, mean=5),
                cat = gl(5, 2, labels = letters[1:5, drop=T]),
                group = gl(2, 1, 10, labels = c("group1", "group2")))

# combine cat and group into a new factor called group.cat
df = transform(df, group.cat = factor(paste(group, cat)))

# reorder the levels of group.cat by the increasing order of val
df = transform(df, group.cat = reorder(group.cat, rank(val)))

# make barplot
ggplot(df, aes(group.cat, val)) +
        geom_bar(aes(fill = cat), stat = "identity") +
        facet_grid(. ~ group, scales = "free_x") +
        scale_x_discrete(labels=df$cat, breaks=df$group.cat) + 
        labs(x = "", size=2)
```
