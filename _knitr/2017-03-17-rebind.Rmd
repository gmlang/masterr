The regular assignment arrow `<-` always creates a variable in the current 
environment. The deep assignment arrow `<<-` never creates a variable in the 
current environment, but instead modifies an existing variable in the 
parent environments. You can also do deep binding with `assign()`: 
`name <<- value is equivalent to assign("name", value, inherits = TRUE)`.
If `<<-` doesnâ€™t find an existing variable, it will create one in the global 
environment. This is usually undesirable because global variables introduce 
non-obvious dependencies between functions. 

In the Environments chapter of Hadley's book
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1466586966/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1466586966&linkCode=as2&tag=cabaceo-20&linkId=2GDWMZSF4NX32QIO">Advanced R</a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cabaceo-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1466586966" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, he gave the following function in exercise.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rebind = function(name, value, env = parent.frame()) {
        if (identical(env, emptyenv())) {
                stop("Can't find ", name, call. = FALSE)
        } else if (exists(name, envir = env, inherits = FALSE)) {
                assign(name, value, envir = env)
        } else {
                rebind(name, value, parent.env(env))
        }
}
```

It behaves like `<<-` except when failing to find an existing variable, 
it runs into an error and stops.
