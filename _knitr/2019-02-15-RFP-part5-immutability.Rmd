Rebinding should not be confused with mutation.

Rebinding is a change to the referencing identifier.
Mutation is a change to the referenced entity.


Consider the following Java code:
        ```
LinkedList<String> list;
list = new LinkedList<String>();
list.add("foo");
list = null;
```
The identifier list initially references nothing (it is uninitialized);
it is then rebound to reference an object (a linked list of strings).
The linked list referenced by list is then mutated, adding a string to the list.
Lastly, list is rebound to null.
