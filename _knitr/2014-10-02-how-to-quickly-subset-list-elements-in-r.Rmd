Every operation in R is a function call. For example, when you subset a vector using `[]`, you're really calling the function `[`. 

```{r}
y = 1:6
y[2]

`[`(y, 2)
```

This allows us to easily subset the elements of a list when the elements are vectors. For example, given a list of 3 elements: a character vector, an integer vector, and a logical vector, we can use `lapply` and `[` to easily extract the 2nd value from each vector. 
```{r}
x = list(letters[1:4], 1:5, c(T, F, T, F, F, T))
lapply(x, `[`, 2)
```
