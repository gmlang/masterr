The [rvest](https://github.com/hadley/rvest) package is yet another 
powerful tool developed by Hadley. It makes web scraping super easy. For example, say I want to scrape [this page](http://www3.boj.or.jp/market/jp/stat/of141205.htm) from the Bank of Japan. I can just use the `read_html()` function without specifying
the encoding. I think under the hood, it guesses the encoding. 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(methods)
library(rvest)
url = "http://www3.boj.or.jp/market/jp/stat/of141205.htm"
page = read_html(url)

# extract title
page %>% html_nodes('title') %>% html_text()

# extract 2nd table
page %>% html_nodes('table') %>% .[[2]] %>% html_table()
```
