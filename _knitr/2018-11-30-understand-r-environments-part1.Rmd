This is the first article of a series on how environments work in R. If this
sounds foreign to you, you're probably wondering, "what is a R environment?" 
Don't. Instead, ask "what does a R environment do?" This is because 99% of the 
utility lies in understanding how it behaves. And yes, you can understand how it 
behaves without knowing what it is, which is confusing given that different 
things are carelessly named the same in the official R manual. For now, just
think of `environment` as a container. Or if you want, you can even take its 
english meaning (after all, programmers try to name things vividly). Every time
you open Rstudio, you're inside an environment called the global environment.
How do I know that? You can check it yourself by running the following command
inside Rstudio. It tells you the current envionment you're in.

```{r}
environment()
```

Take a look at the Environment panel and notice the global env is currently 
empty. Let's put some stuff inside by running the following code block.

```{r}
y = "I'm good"
add_one = function(x) {
        y = x + 1
        g = function() print(y)
        g()
}
```

Look at the Environment panel again and notice the global env now has `y` and `add_one`.

What happens if I call `add_one(1)`? It returns `r add_one(1)`. We see the 
value of `y` defined outside of the `add_one` function doesn't affect the 
value of `y` defined inside. But what's really going on under the hood?

The call `add_one(1)` happened in the global env as I simply ran it inside 
Rstudio without changing the current environment. We say the global env is the
calling environment of the function `add_one()`. If we search for `y`
inside the function's calling environment, we'll get a value of "I'm good."
Obviously, this was not what R did when we ran `add_one(1)` because otherwise,
R would've returned an error as a result of adding a string and integer. So what
did R do?

When we sent `add_one(1)` to R (or when `add_one(1)` was evaluated), a new 
environment was created, with `x` placed inside and associated with the value 1.
Let's call this new environment $$e_1$$. 

Next, the expression `y = x + 1` was evaluated in $$e_1$$, and R searched for 
`x` first in $$e_1$$ and found its value to be 1. Addition was carried out and
`y` was created in $$e_1$$ and associated with a value of 2.

Next, the expression `g = function() print(y)` was evaluated in $$e_1$$. As a 
result, `g` was created in $$e_1$$ and associated with a function 
`function() print(y)`.

Finally, the expression `g()` was evaluated in $$e_1$$. This created another
new environment with nothing inside. Let's call it $$e_2$$. The body of `g` 
asks to print `y`, this made R search for `y`, first inside $$e_2$$ and found 
nothing, and then inside $$e_1$$ and found a value of 2. Under the 
hood, R could move to $$e_1$$ after done with $$e_2$$ because $$e_2$$ was 
pointed to $$e_1$$ by a pointer. We call $$e_1$$ is the parent (environment) of 
$$e_2$$. In general, whenever R cannot find an object inside an environment, 
it'll look for it in its parent environment.

In the second article of the series, I'll talk about the `<<-` operator and 
use it to [code up the mortgage payment calculator](http://masterr.org/r/calculate-mortgage-payment-schedule/) in a 
different fashion. Stay tuned.
